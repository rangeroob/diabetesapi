## Diabetes API

DiabetesAPI is a simple api to monitor blood sugar levels for diabetics(like me) and that can be self hosted as well.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn to make an api that would be useful to me. So I decided to create an api around my diabetes that i could use everyday and I decided on the Ruby programming language because I was more comfortable with it over other languages.
